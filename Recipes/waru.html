        <h2> An image of warus that can be used to make different dishes</h2>
        <p> The above image shows potatoes which are really a favorite of my mother's.<strong> She believes in the supremacy of warus</strong> Since i was a child, we make most of our meals using warus as they make the food heavier and more tasty.<em> My friends</em> Usually joke that warus are not as sweet as we find them but my mother's meals always prove them wrong</p>
        <p> I am a proud supporter of warus and nothing or no one can tell me shit coz look at me? I mean, you gotta believe in waru supremacy<strong><em> Thank you for coming to my ted talk turus</em></strong></p>
